# Real-Time Weather Monitoring System with Rollups and Aggregates

## Overview

This project is a real-time data processing system that monitors weather conditions across major metros in India using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/). The system fetches real-time weather data, processes it, and provides daily summaries, alerts, and visualizations based on user-defined thresholds.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Fetching**: Periodically retrieves weather data (e.g., temperature, weather condition) for metros such as Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, and Hyderabad.
- **Temperature Conversion**: Converts temperature values from Kelvin to Celsius (with user preference support for Fahrenheit).
- **Daily Weather Summary**: Calculates daily aggregates like average, maximum, and minimum temperature, and dominant weather condition.
- **Alerting System**: Alerts the user when certain thresholds (e.g., temperature exceeding 35°C) are breached.
- **Visualizations**: Displays weather summaries, historical data trends, and triggered alerts using graphical elements.
  
## Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Core technologies for building the front-end and client-side logic.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Source for fetching real-time weather data.
- **Live Server**: Use any live server to run `index.html`.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    ```

2. **Get your OpenWeatherMap API Key**:
   - Sign up on [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).
   - Replace the placeholder in the code (`YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`) with your API key.

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in any live server.
   - You can use VS Code with the Live Server extension or any other method to host the site locally.

## Design Choices

- **Data Fetching**: The system fetches data every 5 minutes from the OpenWeatherMap API for specified cities in India.
- **Rollups and Aggregates**: Weather data is processed to provide daily summaries, including average, maximum, minimum temperature, and the most frequent weather condition for each day.
- **Alerting**: The system compares weather data against user-defined thresholds and triggers alerts via console logs or visual indicators.

## Dependencies

- **OpenWeatherMap API**: The system depends on the OpenWeatherMap API for weather data. You will need to sign up and obtain an API key to use the application.
- **Live Server**: This project uses a live server to run the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. You can use any web server or use the Live Server extension in VS Code.

## Test Cases

### 1. System Setup
- Verify that the system successfully starts and connects to the OpenWeatherMap API using a valid API key.

### 2. Data Retrieval
- Ensure the system retrieves weather data for the specified locations and correctly parses the response.

### 3. Temperature Conversion
- Test the conversion from Kelvin to Celsius/Fahrenheit based on user preference.

### 4. Daily Weather Summary
- Simulate a sequence of weather updates and verify that daily summaries (average, max, min temperatures) are calculated correctly.

### 5. Alerting Thresholds
- Configure user-defined thresholds and test alerts when thresholds (e.g., temperature exceeding 35°C) are breached.

## Future Enhancements

- **Support for Additional Weather Parameters**: Extend the system to handle additional weather data like humidity and wind speed.
- **Forecast Retrieval**: Implement forecast-based weather summaries for proactive monitoring.

## Bonus Implementations

- Incorporated **alerts** for high-temperature thresholds.
- Option to display data in both Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- Easy-to-extend for additional weather parameters from OpenWeatherMap.
